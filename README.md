### The challenge

The challenge was to create a responsive design that would look good on both desktop and mobile devices.

### How we've solved the challenge
I used CSS Grid to create a responsive layout that would adjust to different screen sizes.

- Add CSS Grid layout with responsive breakpoints
- Create custom color variables for consistent theming
- Implement smooth transitions for width changes
- Add tablet-specific layout for better UX
- Update README with solution screenshots and learnings

### What I learned

I learned how to use CSS Grid to create a responsive layout that would adjust to different screen sizes.

### Continued development

I would like to continue to improve my responsive design skills by working on more complex projects.
